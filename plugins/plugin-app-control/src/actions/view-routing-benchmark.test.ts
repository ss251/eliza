/**
 * Deterministic view-routing BENCHMARK (#8797, acceptance 8/9).
 *
 * This is the AGGREGATE grid + artifact layer on top of `view-matrix.test.ts`.
 * Where that file asserts each individual cell, this file runs the FULL fixture
 * matrix through the deterministic cascade once, computes a per-(view, language,
 * modality) accuracy grid plus overall / per-language / per-modality rollups,
 * asserts the model-free landed-accuracy floor, and optionally writes a JSON grid
 * artifact when VIEW_ROUTING_BENCHMARK_OUT is set.
 *
 * Model-free and zero-cost: every cell is `resolveIntentView` / `matchViewCommand`
 * over the single-source fixture — no LLM, no network. The accuracy assertions
 * are computed from real resolver output against a real floor; the artifact write
 * is opt-in and best-effort (a filesystem failure must not fail the benchmark,
 * but a missed accuracy floor or a false navigation always does).
 *
 * Floor justification: the exhaustive `view-matrix.test.ts` recall block already
 * passes 100% (every noun form resolves to a *registered* navigable view) and the
 * curated multilingual block lands 100% to the *expected* view. The one cell that
 * does not land on its exact expected view is a known precision-over-recall
 * tie-break (`open voice notes` → `documents`, since `notes` is a documents noun),
 * which still routes to a real navigable view. So an exact-landed floor of 0.99
 * across the curated/noun matrix is honest and non-trivial, and negative-control
 * precision must be a perfect 1.0 (zero false navigations).
