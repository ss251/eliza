/**
 * Planner — action handler hangs longer than its timeout.
 *
 * The scenario registers a one-off plugin that exposes a single action,
 * `SCENARIO_HANG`, whose handler awaits a never-resolving promise so it
 * always exceeds the runtime's per-action timeout. The user's prompt is
 * crafted to invoke that action by name. The agent must:
 *   - surface a timeout-related error / acknowledgment to the user
 *   - NOT silently swallow the failure
 *   - NOT claim success
 *
 * Failure modes guarded:
 *   - hung action causes the entire planner loop to stall without any
 *     user-visible signal
 *   - agent claims "done" when nothing happened
 *   - agent retries forever
 *
 * Cited: 03-coverage-gap-matrix.md row "Action timeout" — listed NONE; no
 * scenario covers this.
