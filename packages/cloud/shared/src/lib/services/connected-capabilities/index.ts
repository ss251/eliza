/**
 * DB-backed entry point for the connected-capability projection service: the
 * Drizzle source loader (each table read filtered by organization ID at the
 * SQL layer) and the process-wide singleton the Cloud API routes import.
 *
 * Each `.select()` below names an explicit column list — never a bare
 * `.select()` — so a token, ciphertext, DEK, or nonce column can never enter
 * Worker memory in the first place; `projection.ts`'s row types are the
 * contract this loader must keep matching (#19883 follow-up). Vendor
 * connections need to know only whether a refresh token exists, computed in
 * SQL (`col IS NOT NULL`) rather than by reading the encrypted value.
 *
 * Every query also carries a hard `.limit()` ordered by `(created_at, id)`,
 * so a request's cost — row fan-out, per-row account-id hashing, and the
 * final cross-source sort in `service.ts` — is bounded by a constant
 * independent of how many rows the organization has accumulated in any one
 * source table, not by the requested page size.
