/**
 * Vitest lane for cloud/shared suites that require the Vitest-only module-mock
 * API (`vi.doMock` + `vi.importActual`), which bun-test's `vi` shim does not
 * implement. The bun `test:cloud` lane picks these files up but they gate to
 * `describe.skip` under bun (see `SUPPORTS_VITEST_MOCK_API`), so without this
 * lane the direct-wallet payer/state-machine proof (40 tests) never runs
 * anywhere — a vacuous skip on the crypto-payments money path. This config
 * runs it for real against in-process PGlite.
 *
 * `default-eliza-character.test.ts` is also listed because it imports from
 * "vitest" and exercises the same Vitest-specific configuration.
 *
 * Do NOT set `passWithNoTests`: if the include glob ever matches nothing, the
 * lane must red rather than silently pass.
