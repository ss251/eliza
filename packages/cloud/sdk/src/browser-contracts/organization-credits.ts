/**
 * Canonical organization-credit denomination and legacy MCP price conversion.
 *
 * Organization balances, checkout grants, ledgers, and UI amounts are stored
 * and transported as USD-denominated cloud-credit units: one credit equals one
 * US dollar. User-MCP pricing historically used cent-like points under a
 * `credits_per_request` name; those values stay storage-compatible and are
 * converted only at the service/API boundary.
 *
 * Every USD amount that leaves this module for a wire contract or a rendered
 * string is quantized to {@link ORGANIZATION_CREDIT_USD_PRECISION} first, so a
 * binary-float remainder can never surface as a price such as
 * `$0.011000000000000001`.
