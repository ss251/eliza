/**
 * API Explorer cloud domain — the single surface for generation/media/API
 * testing. The static endpoint catalog + OpenAPI generator come from
 * `@elizaos/cloud-sdk/api-explorer`; the live pricing overlay is
 * `GET /api/v1/pricing/summary`; the explorer key is auto-minted via
 * `GET /api/v1/api-keys/explorer`; the tester runs REAL, BILLED calls (hence
 * the "API calls are billed" banner). Auth-gated, never public.
 *
 *  - {@link ApiExplorerSurface} is the zero-prop embeddable surface. It gates
 *    on the Steward session itself, so it is safe to mount bare.
 *  - {@link apiExplorerCloudRoute} registers `cloud/api-explorer` at import
 *    time. This path is the *target* of the CloudRouterShell
 *    `cloud/{image,video,gallery,voices}` redirects (the legacy media
 *    generators were folded into the explorer), so it must stay registered for
 *    those redirects to land.
