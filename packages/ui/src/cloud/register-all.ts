/**
 * Boot-time registration aggregator for every app-hosted Eliza Cloud surface.
 *
 * The `CloudRouterShell` renders whatever {@link listCloudRoutes} returns, and
 * the Settings view renders whatever the settings-section registry holds. Every
 * cloud domain registers itself either as an import side effect (top-level
 * `registerCloudRoute(...)` / `registerSettingsSection(...)` calls) or via an
 * explicit `registerX()` function. None of those run unless the modules are
 * imported and the functions are called once at boot.
 *
 * `registerAllCloudSurfaces()` is that single boot hook: the app shell calls it
 * before mounting `CloudRouterShell` so the registry is populated. It is
 * idempotent — every underlying registration guards against double-register or
 * is keyed by route path / section id — so calling it more than once is safe.
 *
 * Account-management surfaces (account, security, plugin grants, billing,
 * API keys, monetization, connectors) are mounted twice on purpose: as in-app
 * Settings sections (the app's own settings hub) AND as standalone
 * `dashboard/*` console pages. The standalone mounts are what make the apex
 * console (elizacloud.ai) work — the agent app never boots there (see
 * `AppCatchAllRoute`), so the console pages are the only reachable home for
 * add-funds / API keys / account on a control-plane host.
