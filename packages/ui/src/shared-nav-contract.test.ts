/**
 * Cross-package contract pin for the shared-tier navigation vocabulary
 * (#17020/#17032): every view id the Tier-0 shared runtime may emit in a VIEWS
 * handoff must resolve on this client — either as a builtin shell view at its
 * canonical path, or as a plugin-declared page a dedicated runtime registers.
 * A new SHARED_NAV_TARGETS entry without a client resolution fails here before
 * it can ship a confident "Opening X for you." reply into nowhere: the client
 * resolves emitted ids against its routable registry (PR #17021), but an id
 * that registry cannot resolve still falls back to a blind /apps/<id>
 * navigation — the designed not-found render for unclaimed /apps/<slug> routes
 * is #17033. Builtin ids run against the real registry, no mocks; plugin ids
 * are pinned to their declaring plugin source files read from the monorepo, so
 * a plugin renaming its view id or path breaks this test instead of silently
 * reintroducing the drift.
