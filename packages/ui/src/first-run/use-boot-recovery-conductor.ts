/**
 * In-chat boot-recovery conductor (headless).
 *
 * When the agent fails to come up — a cold boot that outlasts the stall
 * threshold, or a shared→dedicated cloud handoff that times out / fails — this
 * hook seeds ONE live assistant turn (`boot:recovery`) into the SAME transcript
 * the floating chat renders, phrased as the agent asking for help with a
 * SPECIFIC remedy: re-log in when the Eliza Cloud session is unusable, retry
 * the handoff when dedicated-agent setup stalled, plain reconnect otherwise.
 * There is deliberately NO floating banner/pill above the chat for boot state
 * — the transcript is the single voice (the old `BootStatusIndicator` pill and
 * `CloudHandoffBanner` toast read as clutter and offered only a generic
 * settings escape).
 *
 * The card's `__boot_recovery__:` controls route through the boot-recovery
 * action channel — never to the server. The card updates in place, is removed
 * the moment the agent is healthy, and never renders during onboarding
 * (`firstRunComplete === false`): the first-run conductor owns every word on
 * that screen and surfaces its own sign-in retries. The no-provider state is
 * likewise excluded — the transcript's no-provider gate is that honest surface.
