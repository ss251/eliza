/**
 * Structural triage signals for cross-platform messages.

 * word-presence-based, so "no deadline on this" read as urgent). It attaches
 * only typed structural facts the model cannot cheaply derive from the
 * message text itself:
 *   - contact weight (relationship category resolved via RelationshipsService)
 *   - whether the user previously replied in the message's thread
 * and orders the feed by recency, with contact weight as the tie-break.
