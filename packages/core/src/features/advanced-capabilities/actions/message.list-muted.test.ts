/**
 * Muted visibility and count integrity in the MESSAGE list ops: list_channels
 * carries a per-channel `muted` flag, list_servers a per-server `muted`
 * flag, and list_connections a `mutedRoomCount`, resolved from the same
 * participant/world state the ROOM action writes — making "which channels or
 * servers are you muted in" answerable. Counts must cover the connector's
 * COMPLETE room set even when the rendered listing is capped, and a capped
 * listing is annotated (truncated + channelCount) rather than posing as
 * complete. Map-backed runtime + mock connectors.
