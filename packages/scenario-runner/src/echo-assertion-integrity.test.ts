/**
 * Rejects echo-satisfiable scenario assertions.
 *
 * `responseIncludesAny` / `responseIncludesAll` assert by case-insensitive
 * substring match against the agent's reply. When every keyword in the array
 * also appears in the scenario's own user turn text, the assertion is
 * "echo-satisfiable": the agent can pass by parroting the prompt, so the check
 * cannot fail for the real reason. These are weak assertions that should be
 * rewritten to assert the agent's *effect* (finalChecks / memory writes /
 * connector ledger), not words already present in the input.
 *
 * Rewriting the existing backlog requires per-scenario work with live runs
 * (tracked in #9310). This guard is a guard: it does not fix the backlog, but
 * it prevents it from growing. The count may only go DOWN. When you rewrite
 * echo-satisfiable scenarios, lower BASELINE to match. Adding a new
 * echo-satisfiable scenario turns this RED.
