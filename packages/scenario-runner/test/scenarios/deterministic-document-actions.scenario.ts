/**
 * Keyless catalog coverage for the core DOCUMENT umbrella action's delete
 * contract (#16942). Runs on the pr-deterministic lane; live-document-delete
 * proves a real model routes the same path from natural phrasing.
 *
 * Exercises the real DOCUMENT handler and DocumentService end to end against
 * real DB state: a seeded global document is listed, a non-owner delete is
 * refused by the owner-only mutation wall (the document must survive), the
 * owner delete succeeds (the document must actually be gone), and the
 * not-found / missing-id rejections are pinned. The guest room's account maps
 * to a second entity that is NOT the executor-configured canonical owner
 * (ELIZA_ADMIN_ENTITY_ID); the seed makes it a connector-admin (ADMIN) via
 * the roles whitelist + a stamped connector identity, matching
 * live-document-delete's fixture, so the wall is exercised with the real
 * roles.ts resolution against the strongest non-owner tier it admits,
 * nothing mocked.
