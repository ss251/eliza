/**
 * Canonical navigation vocabulary for Tier-0 shared-runtime agents: the map
 * from a view-command-matcher id to the CLIENT view id + human label a turn may
 * emit in a VIEWS handoff. The shared tier emits only these ids; the client
 * resolves each id against its routable view registry (#17020, PR #17021), but
 * an id that registry cannot resolve still falls back to a blind /apps/<id>
 * navigation — the designed not-found render for unclaimed /apps/<slug> routes
 * is #17033 — so every entry here must be client-resolvable. Matcher ids and
 * client ids are separate namespaces — the matcher's "wallet" resolves to the
 * builtin "inventory" tab — so this table is the single translation point, and
 * it deliberately omits matcher ids with no shared-tier client surface (e.g.
 * "help", "camera") so those utterances fall through to the normal LLM turn
 * instead of navigating nowhere (#17032). The vocabulary is pinned by the
 * cross-package contract test packages/ui/src/shared-nav-contract.test.ts.
