/**
 * Owner-candidate inference for voice (#8785).
 *
 * "How does the agent know which speaker is the device OWNER?" Today the owner
 * entity must be enrolled explicitly (the first-run voice flow). But when no
 * owner is set, the agent should still be able to FORM a hypothesis from what it
 * hears — the person who speaks to it most, most confidently, and clearly more
 * than anyone else is the likely owner. This is the pure decision logic a
 * provider/evaluator runs when the owner is unknown: it accumulates recognized
 * voice turns and proposes a candidate only when the evidence is both sufficient
 * (enough confident observations) and unambiguous (a clear lead over the
 * runner-up). Otherwise it stays UNDECIDED — it never guesses an owner from one
 * stray turn, because a wrong owner is a security and personalization hazard.
 *
 * Pure (no I/O, no models); the runtime feeds it the diarized/recognized
 * observations and acts on a decided candidate (e.g. prompt to confirm, or set
 * the owner setting). The Voice Workbench exercises the SAME function so the
 * inference is benchmarked, not just shipped.
